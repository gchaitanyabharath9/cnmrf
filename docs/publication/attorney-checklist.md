# EB-1A Attorney Filing Checklist

## 1. Petition Narrative Readiness
*   [ ] Each mention of CNMRF defines it strictly as a "platform-neutral reference framework."
*   [ ] References to "Product," "SaaS," or "Business" have been scrubbed.
*   [ ] Distinction between v1.0 (Core) and v1.1.0 (Refinement) is clearly articulated.
*   [ ] "Major Significance" argument focuses on solving the industry "Implementation Gap."

## 2. Exhibit Labeling & Ordering
*   [ ] Primary contributions (Exh 1-4) appear before supporting articles (Exh 5-6).
*   [ ] Exhibit titles match the cross-reference table exactly.
*   [ ] v1.1.0 extension is labeled as a "supplement" or "enhancement" to the core work.

## 3. Recommendation Letter Alignment
*   [ ] Expert letters reference "implementation patterns" and "vendor neutrality" specifically.
*   [ ] Letters avoid claiming commercial success, revenue, or business valuation.
*   [ ] Timeline in letters is consistent with the v1.0 release date.

## 4. Public Evidence Verification
*   [ ] GitHub URLs are active and publicly accessible.
*   [ ] Repository screenshots clearly show tags `v1.0.0` and `v1.1.0`.
*   [ ] Commit timestamps are visible and align with the narrative timeline.

## 5. Version Control Verification
*   [ ] `v1.0.0` tag exists and matches the Freeze Declaration.
*   [ ] `v1.1.0` tag exists and matches the Extension Declaration.
*   [ ] Release Notes for both versions are confirmed as non-commercial/academic in tone.

## 6. Final Consistency Check (STOP/GO)
*   [ ] **STOP:** If any document implies CNMRF is for sale or subscription.
*   [ ] **STOP:** If v1.1.0 is presented as a "new product launch" rather than an extension.
*   [ ] **GO:** If all artifacts frame CNMRF as an open, educational contribution to the field.
