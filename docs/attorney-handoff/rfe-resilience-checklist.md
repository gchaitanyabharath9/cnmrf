# RFE Resilience Checklist

## Narrative Check
*   [ ] "Platform-Neutral Reference Framework" is the consistent descriptor.
*   [ ] No mention of "product," "SaaS," or "startup" exists.
*   [ ] v1.0 and v1.1.0 separation is clear (Core vs Extension).

## Evidence Check
*   [ ] All GitHub links are public and resolving.
*   [ ] Timestamps on tags (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) pre-date filing.
*   [ ] IP Ownership doc (`docs/governance/ip-ownership...`) is included to prove beneficiary rights.

## Independence Check
*   [ ] Letters do not imply the work was "work for hire."
*   [ ] Narrative emphasizes "contribution to the field," not "contribution to an employer."

## Final Gate
*   [ ] **READY TO FILE** only if all above are checked.
