# Documentation Index

This directory contains the comprehensive documentation for the Cloud-Native Modernization Reference Framework (CNMRF). The documentation is structured to provide architectural guidance, implementation patterns, and governance standards for adopting cloud-native systems.

## Documentation Structure

*   **[architecture/](architecture/README.md)** - Core architectural patterns, diagrams, and non-functional requirements.
*   **[adr/](adr/README.md)** - Architecture Decision Records detailing the rationale behind design choices.
*   **[security/](security/README.md)** - Security baselines, compliance standards, and access control patterns.
*   **[resiliency/](resiliency/README.md)** - Patterns for system reliability, fault tolerance, and circuit breaking.
*   **[platform/](platform/README.md)** - Guidance for platform engineering and internal developer platforms.
*   **[cicd/](cicd/README.md)** - Reference patterns for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
*   **[governance/](governance/README.md)** - Project governance, scope definition, and contribution guidelines.
*   **[publication/](publication/README.md)** - Records of public dissemination, copyright documentation, and publication history.

## Suggested Reading Order

1.  **Project Outline:** Review `governance/project-outline.md` to understand the framework's scope and purpose.
2.  **Architecture:** Consult `architecture/README.md` to understand the fundamental patterns and components.
3.  **Decision Records:** Read `adr/README.md` to understand the "why" behind key technical decisions.
4.  **Domain Standards:** Review specific baselines in `security/` and `resiliency/` based on implementation needs.
5.  **Implementation:** Refer to specific service templates in the root `templates/` directory after understanding the architectural context.
