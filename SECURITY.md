## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this framework is a reference architecture, "vulnerabilities" typically relate to insecurity in the recommended patterns rather than binary exploits.

To report a security design flaw:
1.  Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.
2.  Email the maintainer at [gchaitanyabharath9@gmail.com] with the subject "CNMRF Security Design Flaw".
3.  We will review the architectural pattern and release an errata or updated pattern within 14 days.

## Zero Trust Philosophy
CNMRF assumes a "Zero Trust" posture. If you identify a pattern that implicitly trusts a network segment or identity without verification, this is considered a critical design bug.
