## Scope & Principles
*   **Platform Neutrality:** All contributions must remain vendor-agnostic.

## Governance
*   Major architectural changes require an ADR (Architecture Decision Record).
*   All contributions are licensed under Apache 2.0.

## Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a feature branch.
